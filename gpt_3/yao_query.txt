Here are two original text I tried (breaking lines for readability):

The architecture of Winchester College is a diverse set of architectural styles, reflecting the multiple periods of building 
from the college's foundation in 1382, through additions in the medieval and Early Modern periods, to a major expansion of 
accommodation in the Victorian era and then further extensions at the turn of the 20th century and more recently.

Football fans around the world may find some apprehensions about going to the World Cup in Qatar because of the alcohol 
laws concerning consuming alcohol in public places, but World Cup organizers announce the creation of designated "sobering up" 
zones as a way to make fans feel safe and comfortable while attending the World Cup.
