873:873	Unlike other large U.S. airlines which mostly use hub-and-spoke systems, Southwest uses point-to-point operations and underwent a massive crew scheduling "meltdown" because most of its pilots and flight attendants were out of position, which resulted in massive numbers of flight cancellations persisting for days after the worst weather had subsided and other airlines had largely recovered.	N/A	Southwest airlines cancel a lot of flights for a few days even after the worst weather had reduced. || This happened because Southwest uses a different system for scheduling flights than other major airlines. || Instead of using big transit centers, Southwest's flights go directly from one place to another. || Because of this, many of the pilots and flight attendants were not in the right place, which caused the cancellations.
