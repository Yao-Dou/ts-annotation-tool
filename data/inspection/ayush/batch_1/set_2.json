        "simplified": "On 14 November, Piers Morgan interviewed Ronaldo, who expressed feeling \"let down\" by ten Hag and a few others who wanted him to leave the club. || He also said the club \"questioned\" him when he said he was not available to attend pre-season training due to his daughter being ill. Ronaldo added that he felt ten Hag lacked \"regard for me\", which ultimately caused Ronaldo to be unhappy with the communication from the club.",
