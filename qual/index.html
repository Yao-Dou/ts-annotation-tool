                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Welcome! In this project you will read simplified sentences generated by Artificial Intelligence and rate their quality.</p>

                <p>This qualification HIT will train you to perform this task. You must be able to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Find the changes our AI made (i.e. "<b><i>selecting spans</i></b>")</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the quality of each change</li>
                    <li>Identify errors in each change</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here's a big picture of what we're doing:</p>
                <img src="./img/overview.png" alt="Big picture of the task" width="1200">
                <br />
                <todo>One other idea I had is to add interactives throughout the tutorial. Like selecting whether a span is a hallucination or insertion, selecting the severity of a deletion, etc.</todo>

            <tab-content title="Selecting Alignments">
                <h1>Selecting Alignments</h1>
                <p>
                    We'll begin by understanding the ways our AI simplifies sentences. Each individual highlight is called a <i>edit</i>. Your task is to <i>align</i> the edits between the complex and simplified sentences.
                </p>
                <h2>Types of Edits</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <ed>Deletion Edits</ed> - The AI attempted to <b><i>simplify by deleting</i></b> unnecessary information.
                        </li><li>
                            <ei>Insertion Edits</ei> - The AI attempted to <b><i>add clarity</i></b> by adding information which didn't previously exist.
                        </li><li>
                            <es>Substitution Edits</es> - The AI attempted to <b><i>reword a complicated phrase or concept</i></b>
                        </li><li>
                            <esp>Splitting Edits</esp> - The AI attemped to <b><i>split a complex sentence</i></b> into two simpler sentences.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Here's an example of what selecting alignments looks like for one sentence:</p>
                <img src="./img/span-selection.gif" alt="Big picture of the task" width="600">
                <br />
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <example-sent 
                    explanation="This is a substitution. We see the “an easy fix” takes the place of “a straightforward solution” in the sentence.">
                    <template #complex-sent><es class="original_span" data-id="0">A straightforward solution</es> for foggy car windows is run the heater.</template>
                    <template #simple-sent><es class="simplified_span" data-id="0">An easy fix</es> for foggy car windows is run the heater.</template>
                </example-sent>

                <example-sent 
                    explanation="This is a deletion. We see “Contrary to popular belief” was entirely removed with nothing taking it's place in the sentence.">
                    <template #complex-sent><ed>Contrary to popular belief</ed>, the moon is made of rocks, not cheese.</template>
                    <template #simple-sent>The moon is made of rocks, not cheese.</template>
                </example-sent>

                <example-sent

                </example-sent>

                <h2>How much do we select?</h2>
                <p>
                    Generally, you want to select the <b><i>smallest amount of text</i></b> which contains the edit as possible. Sometimes there can be two different types of edits next to each other. If a edit seems too large, try to highlight multiple edits instead.
                </p>
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <example-sent
                    explanation="While “straightforward solution” and “, which can sometimes takes a while,” appeared next to each other, the phrase “easy fix” is only substituting the words “starightforward solution” and the phrase “, which can sometimes takes a while,” isn’t contained anywhere else in the sentence.">

                </example-sent>

                <example-sent 
                    explanation="Substitutions may be on another side of the sentence. “is known as data fitting” is referring to “Data fitting is” even though it has been moved.">

                <p>Now we've selected the alignments, let's look at how to annotate them. We'll look at each edit type, starting with deletions.</p>
                <p>A deletion is an attempt to <b>simplify by deleting</b> unnecessary, irrelevant or complicated information or concepts.</p>

                <h2>Rating by Severity</h2>
                <p>
                    When content is deleted from a sentence, it will always contain some amount of information. We also ask that you rate <i>how significant</i> the deleted content is to the <i>main idea</i> of the original sentence. You will rate the significance on a 4 point scale.
                </p>
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>Observe this original sentence:</p>
                <div class="ex-sent bt-sent-cont">
                    <p class="sent-desc">Original Sentence (Human Written):</p>
                    <div class="sent">

                <p>This sentence communicates many different facts. Here are just a few:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li id="bt-1" class="deletion-examples deletion-examples-active">Booker T. Washington was born in Virginia</li>
                    <li id="bt-2" class="deletion-examples">Booker T. Washington was born in 1856</li>
                    <li id="bt-3" class="deletion-examples">Booker T. Washington was born into slavery</li>
                    <li id="bt-4" class="deletion-examples">Booker T. Washington was an influential leader</li>
                    <li id="bt-5" class="deletion-examples">Booker T. Washington was a African American leader</li>
                    <li id="bt-6" class="deletion-examples">Booker T. Washington was a influential African American leader as a result of being born into slavery</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Hover over each fact to see which part of the sentence could be deleted to remove the fact from the sentence. As you can see, sentences which communicate many ideas may be hard to narrow down whether a span is <i>significant</i>.</p>
                <p>In this case, the <i>main idea</i> of the sentence is <i>Booker T. Washington is an influential African American leader</i>. Deletions are necessary for text simplification, we just want to ensure this <i>main idea</i> is still being communicated.</p>

                <h1>Annotating Insertions</h1>
                <p>An insertion is an attempt to <b><i>add clarity</i></b> by adding information which didn't previously exist. While deletions are straightforward, insertions come in many different forms. There are three types of insertions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Elaboration</b> - Added meaningful and correct extra information</li>
                    <li><b>Hallucination</b> - Added irrelevant, incorrect or incoherent information</li>
                    <li><b>Trivial Insertion</b> - Added minor wording (the, a, etc.)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Quiz</h2>
                <p>Now it’s your turn! Take a look at these sentences and rate the insertions for type and quality.</p>

                <h1>Annotating Substitutions</h1>
                <p>Now that you learn what are deletions and insertions, let's look at a more complicated edit type: the substitution. </p>
                <p>A substitution edit <b>rephrases a span</b> in the original sentence with another span.
                    Remember a substitution is distict from an insertion or a deletion, because it rewords some information which previously existed in the sentence.
                    A substitution always adds, deletes or retains information, but sometimes it rewrites a phrase to an entirely different meaning.</p>
                <h2>Disinguish between substitution and deletion + insertion</h2>
                <p>Substitution and deletion + insertion sometimes are hard to differentiate, but here are the rules to help you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mark as <b>substitution</b>, if both spans are about same type of content (actions, locations, ...).</li>
                    <li>Mark as <b>deletion + insertion</b>, otherwise.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As mentioned before, substitution is categorized into four types as the new phrase expresses: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the same meaning (paraphrase)</li>

                <h1>Annotating Splits</h1>
                <p>A sentence split is an attempt to simplify the complex original sentence by
                    splitting it into two or more simpler sentences. Although the split edits are
                    easy to spot and are automatically marked as a <span class="txt-split">||</span> symbol,
                    split edits are always accompanied by other edits like deletion, substitution, or insertion, which you need to mark as well.</p>
                <p>
                    For example, to split a sentence, simply adding punctuation marks such as periods is not enough, as the new sentences should be grammatically correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Splits can either be good or unnecessary. A good split is one that makes the sentence simpler and easier to understand. An unnecessary split is one that does not make the sentence simpler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A split can also introduce a grammar / fluency error, like any other edits.
