                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Welcome! In this project you will read simplified sentences generated by Artificial Intelligence and rate their quality.</p>

                <p>This qualification HIT will train you to perform this task. You must be able to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Find the changes our AI made (i.e. "<b><i>selecting spans</i></b>")</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the quality of each change</li>
                    <li>Identify errors in each change</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here's a big picture of what we're doing:</p>

                <h1>Selecting Alignments</h1>
                <p>
                    We'll begin by understanding the ways our AI simplifies sentences. Each individual highlight is called a <i>edit</i>. Your task is to <i>align</i> the edits between the complex and simplified sentences.
                </p>

                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <example-sent 
                    explanation="This is a substitution. We see the “an easy fix” takes the place of “a straightforward solution” in the sentence.">

                <example-sent 
                    explanation="This is a deletion. We see “Contrary to popular belief” was entirely removed with nothing taking it's place in the sentence.">

                <h2>How much do we select?</h2>
                <p>
                    Generally, you want to select the <b><i>smallest amount of text</i></b> which contains the edit as possible. Sometimes there can be two different types of edits next to each other. If a edit seems too large, try highlight multiple edits instead.
                </p>
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <example-sent 
                    explanation="While “straightforward solution” and “, which can sometimes takes a while,” appeared next to each other, the phrase “easy fix” is only substituting the words “starightforward solution” and the phrase “, which can sometimes takes a while,” isn’t contained anywhere else in the sentence.">
                    <template #complex-sent>A <es>straightforward solution</es><ed>, which can sometimes takes a while</ed>, for foggy car windows is to run the heater</template>

                <example-sent 
                    explanation="Substitutions may be on another side of the sentence. “is known as data fitting” is referring to “Data fitting is” even though it has been moved.">

                    In the real HIT, we have trained another AI to provide the alignment for you. However, this AI is frequently wrong (it will be wrong for almost every HIT), so please simply fix its alignments. Go ahead and try it!

                <p>
                    When content is deleted from a sentence, it will always contain some amount of information. We also ask that you rate <i>how significant</i> the deleted content is to the <i>main idea</i> of the original sentence. You will rate the significance on a 4 point scale.
                </p>
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>Observe this sentence:</p>
                <div class="ex-sent" style="margin-bottom: 0px">
                    <p class="sent-desc">Original Sentence (Human Written):</p>

                <p>This sentence communicates many different facts. Here are just a few:</p>

                    <li>Booker T. Washington was born in Virginia</li>

                    <li>Booker T. Washington was an influential leader</li>

                    explanation="1. The introductory clause “Like so many hyped books before it,” situates the sentence within the context of “hyped books.” However, it doesn’t relate to the main idea of the sentence: the author’s opinion on The Midnight Library.">

                <p>An insertion is an attempt to <b><i>add clarity</i></b> by adding information which didn't previously exist. While deletions are straightforward, insertions come in many different forms. There are three types of insertions:</p>

                    <li><b>Elaboration</b> - Added meaningful and correct extra information</li>
                    <li><b>Hallucination</b> - Added irrelevant, incorrect or incoherent information</li>
                    <li><b>Trivial Insertion</b> - Added minor wording (the, a, etc.)</li>
